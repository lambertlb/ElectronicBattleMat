	<h2 id="Overview">Electronic Battle Mat Overview</h2>
	<p>Electronic Battle mat is a Web Application to help DMs and
		players have a better experience for running a role playing game. It
		encompasses three modes of operation.
	<ol>
		<li>Creating and editing Template dungeons</li>
		<p>Template dungeons contain all the maps and resources needed for
			managing a single adventure. It is called a template because it is
			not actually used directly by end users. This is because multiple
			groups could be playing the same dungeon at the same time and you
			would not want them to interfere with each other.</p>
		<li>Creating Dungeon Session</li>
		<p>A dungeon session is a copy of a dungeon template that is owned
			by a certain group. This session is private so it can be changed
			without interfering with other groups playing the same one.</p>
		<li>DMing a Session</li>
		<p>
			In this mode of operation a DM takes control of a session. They can
			do may things like clear areas of FOG of WAR so players can see
			stuff. They can make monsters and room objects visible or invisible
			to players. They can move pogs around the map to show correct positions.
			They can add new stuff like monsters that were not in the dungeon
			template <b>SURPRISE this dragon happened by and wants to eat
				your face</b>.
		</p>
		<li>Player joining a Session</li>
		<p>In this mode of operation a player can view the Battle Mat.
			They have very little functionality other than panning and zooming
			the map. They can also create a PC pog and move it around the visible
			areas of the map.</p>
	</ol>
	</p>
	<h2 id="CreateNewDungeon">Creating a New Dungeon</h2>
	<p>
		These are the steps to create a new dungeon. They are performed in the
		Dungeon Manager Dialog when &quot;<b>I am DM</b>&quot; is checked
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Select Template Dungeon</li>
		<p>
			This dungeon will be copied as a starting point for the new dungeon.
			Typically you would select the &quot;<b>Template Dungeon</b>&quot;.
			This will also make the text box with the text &quot;<b>Enter
				Dungeon Name</b>&quot; editable.
		</p>
		<li>Name the new dungeon</li>
		<p>
			In the text box labeled "<b>Enter Dungeon Name</b>&quot; enter the
			name of your new dungeon. You can use letters, numbers and spaces in
			the name. The name must be greater than 4 letters long and cannot
			match an existing name. Once a legal name is entered the &quot;<b>Create
				New Dungeon</b>&quot; button will be enabled.
		</p>
		<li>Click the &quot;<b>Create New Dungeon</b>&quot; button
			<p>
				This will create a new dungeon with the entered name by copying the
				selected dungeon. It should now be visible in the &quot;<b>Select
					a Dungeon for Operations</b>&quot; list.
			</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
