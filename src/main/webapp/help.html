	<h2 id="Overview">Electronic Battle Mat Overview</h2>
	<p>Electronic Battle mat is a Web Application to help DMs and
		players have a better experience for running a role playing game. It
		encompasses four modes of operation.
	<ol>
		<li>Creating and editing Template dungeons</li>
		<p>Template dungeons contain all the maps and resources needed for
			managing a single adventure. It is called a template because it is
			not actually used directly by end users. This is because multiple
			groups could be playing the same dungeon at the same time and you
			would not want them to interfere with each other.</p>
		<li>Creating Dungeon Session</li>
		<p>A dungeon session is a copy of a dungeon template that is owned
			by a certain group. This session is private so it can be changed
			without interfering with other groups playing the same one.</p>
		<li>DMing a Session</li>
		<p>
			In this mode of operation a DM takes control of a session. They can
			do may things like clear areas of FOG of WAR so players can see
			stuff. They can make monsters and room objects visible or invisible
			to players. They can move pogs around the map to show correct
			positions. They can add new stuff like monsters that were not in the
			dungeon template <b>SURPRISE this dragon happened by and wants to
				eat your face</b>.
		</p>
		<li>Player joining a Session</li>
		<p>In this mode of operation a player can view the Battle Mat.
			They have very little functionality other than panning and zooming
			the map. They can also create a PC pog and move it around the visible
			areas of the map.</p>
	</ol>


	<h2 id="DungeonEditorLayout>">Dungeon Editor Layout</h2>
	<p>This is how the editor should look when it is first opened up on
		a new dungeon created from the "Template" dungeon.</p>
	<img src="help/DungeonEditor.png">
	<ol>
		<li>This is the <a href="#RibbonBar">Ribbon Bar area</a>.
		</li>
		<li>This is the <a href="#BattleMat">Battle Mat area</a>.
		</li>
		<li>This is the <a href="#InformationManagement">Information
				Management area</a>.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h3 id="RibbonBar">Ribbon Bar Area</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Selected Pog Area</li>
		<img src="help/RibbonBar1.png">
		<p>This will show the picture of the currently selected Pog. You
			can click and drag in this area to place a copy of the pog onto the
			map.</p>
		<li>Level Selection Area</li>
		<img src="help/RibbonBar2.png">
		<p>This is where you select which dungeon level you wish to view
			or edit.</p>
		<li>Show Pog Notes Checkbox</li>
		<img src="help/RibbonBar3.png">
		<p>By checking this box you will cause a floating dialog window to
			appear. This window will allow you to view and edit the notes placed
			on a pog. You can edit both regular notes which are viewable by the
			players or DM notes only viewable by the DM.</p>
		<li>Show Selected Pog Checkbox</li>
		<img src="help/RibbonBar4.png">
		<p>By checking this box you will cause a floating dialog window to
			appear. This window will allow you to view the picture of the
			selected pog. You can resize the window by dragging in the lower
			right corner allowing you to get a better view.</p>
		<li>Show Help</li>
		<img src="help/RibbonBar5.png">
		<p>By clicking here you will get this help page.</p>
	</ol>
	<h3 id="BattleMat">Battle Mat Area</h3>
	<p>
		This area is where the map and all the objects placed on it appear.
		When you are DMing a session this will also display the areas that
		have <b>Fog of War (FOW)</b> on them. It will be transparent to the DM
		but will be solid black to the players preventing them from seeing
		stuff. Following are a few things you can do with and to this area.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Pan the Map</li>
		<p>By clicking on the map and holding the mouse button down you
			can change the position of the map.</p>
		<li>Zoom the Map</li>
		<p>By spinning the center mouse button you can zoom in and out of
			the map.</p>
		<li>Move Pogs around</li>
		<p>You can click on a pog and drag it to a new spot.</p>
		<li>Add new pogs to map</li>
		<p>By dragging and dropping a picture of a pog from the ribbon bar
			you will create a new pog on the map. This is a copy of the pog and
			not the original. So if you want two more of a monster already on the
			map. You just need to select it so it shows in the ribbon bar then
			drag and drop twice from the ribbon bar.</p>
		<li>Change properties of a pog</li>
		<p>By right clicking on a pog you can change some properties. Like
			make it visible or invisible to players or give it a number to help
			players more easily identify it. You can even delete it from the map.</p>
		<li>Adjust Fog of War</li>
		<p>Dms have the ability to adjust what the players see I.E. change
			the fog of war. This can be done several ways only when DMing a
			session</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Toggle FOW check box on ribbon bar</li>
			<p>The DM can enable this mode by clicking in the checkbox. Once
				in this mode you can click on the map in a grid square. The FOW in
				that square will toggle. If you hold down the mouse button and move
				around the map other squares will also change to what the starting
				one was.</p>
			<li>Shift click in a grid square</li>
			<p>The DM can change FOW by just holding SHIFT key down and
				clicking in a square. The FOW in that square will toggle. If you
				hold down the mouse button and move around the map other squares
				will also change to what the starting one was.</p>
			<li>Control click in a grid square</li>
			<p>The DM can change FOW by just holding Control key down and
				clicking in a square. Now you drag to form a red rectangle. All the
				squares in to rectangle will change to the opposite of the first one
				you clicked in.</p>
		</ol>
	</ol>
	<h3 id="InformationManagement">Information Management area</h3>
	<p>This area allows the DM to edit and create all kinds of
		information related to the dungeon. It is broken into different tabs
		to help separate functionality.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Art Assets</li>
		<p>This area allows you to manage the artwork needed for you
			dungeon</p>
		<li>Dungeon Editor</li>
		<p>This area allows you to edit and add dungeon levels</p>
		<li>Pog Editor</li>
		<p>This area allows you to do things like edit, create and delete
			pogs.</p>
	</ol>


	<h2 id="CreateNewDungeon">Creating a New Dungeon</h2>
	<p>These are the steps to create a new dungeon. You have access to
		this dialog just after you log in.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Check the <b>I am DM</b> check box
		</li>
		<p>This opens up all the operations and privileges of a Dungeon
			Master.</p>
		<li>Name the new dungeon</li>
		<p>
			In the text box labeled "<b>Enter Dungeon Name</b>&quot; enter the
			name of your new dungeon. You can use letters, numbers and spaces in
			the name. The name must be greater than 4 letters long and cannot
			match an existing name. Once a legal name is entered the &quot;<b>Create
				New Dungeon</b>&quot; button will be enabled.
		</p>
		<img src="help/ManageDungeons2.png">
		<li>Click the &quot;<b>Create New Dungeon</b>&quot; button
			<p>
				This will create a new dungeon with the entered name by copying the
				"Template" dungeon. It should now be visible in the &quot;<b>Select
					a Dungeon for Operations</b>&quot; list.
			</p> <img src="help/ManageDungeons7.png">
		</li>
	</ol>


	<h2 id="EditDungeon">Editing a Dungeon</h2>
	<p>These are the steps to edit a dungeon.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Check the <b>I am DM</b> check box
		</li>
		<p>This opens up all the operations and privileges of a Dungeon
			Master.</p>
		<li>Select a Dungeon to edit</li>
		<p>
			In the drop down called &quot;<b>Select a Dungeon for Operations</b>&quot;
			select a dungeon to edit. This will enable the &quot;<b>Edit
				Dungeon</b>&quot; button.
		</p>
		<li>Press the &quot;<b>Edit Dungeon</b>&quot; button
		</li>
		<p>This will load in the dungeon and display the first level map.
			The ribbon bar will also map to the available operations that the DM
			can do on the dungeon.</p>
	</ol>



	<h2 id="ManageArtAssets">Managing Art Assets</h2>
	<p>One of the first operations you will probably need to do is
		manage some of the art assets. Specifically you will probably want to
		have access to a picture that will be used for this level of the
		dungeon</p>
	<img src="help/ArtAssets1.png">
	<p>Above you can see that there are already some assets available
		and they belong in three categories.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Dungeon Assets</li>
		<p>All items in this list belong specifically to the Dungeon you
			are currently editing. For example level1.png is the picture for
			level 1. So if you need to add or subtract any artwork for your
			dungeon it would be in this list. dungeonData.json is a JSON
			formatted text file containing all the information about the dungeon.
			You should not need to manipulate this file manually. You can edit it
			using the Dungeon Editor Tab</p>
		<li>Global Monster Assets</li>
		<p>This list contains any pictures for monsters that you wish to
			have available across all dungeons. pogs.json is a JSON formatted
			text file containing the pog information that uses the pictures. You
			should not need to manipulate this file manually. You can edit it
			using the Pog Editor Tab.</p>
		<li>Global Room Assets</li>
		<p>This list contains any pictures for room objects that you wish
			to have available across all dungeons. pogs.json is a JSON formatted
			text file containing the pog information that uses the pictures. You
			should not need to manipulate this file manually. You can edit it
			using the Pog Editor Tab.</p>
	</ol>

	<h2 id="AddingArtAssets">Adding Art Assets</h2>
	<p>Following is how you would add an art asset.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Select where you want the asset to be uploaded to.</li>
		<p>
			For example you may wish this to be a dungeon asset so select the <b>Dungeon
				Assets</b> area. You can select either the top level or any items in the
			list. This will enable the <b>Choose File</b> button.
		</p>
		<img src="help/ArtAssets2.png">
		<li>Choose file you wish to upload.</li>
		<p>
			Click the <b>Choose File</b> button then navigate to and select the
			picture file you wish to upload then press the open button. The
			filename should show up next to the Choose File button. The <b>Upload
				Asset</b> button should become enabled.
		</p>
		<li>Upload the file.</li>
		<p>
			Click the <b>Upload Asset</b> button to actually upload it to the
			server. The list should update and show you the new file.
		</p>
	</ol>

	<h2 id="DeletingArtAssets">Deleting Art Assets</h2>
	<p>
		Select the item you wish to delete and the <b>Delete Asset</b> button
		will enable. Just click it to delete the asset. Some assets like
		dungeonData or pogs .json files cannot be deleted.
	</p>

	<h2 id="SelectingArtAssets">Selecting Art Assets</h2>
	<p>When you need to use an art asset in either the Dungeon Editor
		or the Pog Editor just select a picture file in one of the lists. The
		file path for the file you selected will show up under the buttons at
		the top of the panel. This path is also save internally and is
		available to be used by the mentioned editor. See those editors on the
		specifics on how to get at it.</p>

	<h2 id="ManageDungeonLevels">Managing Dungeon Levels</h2>
	<p>
		The tab labeled <b>Dungeon Editor</b> allows you to edit levels of the
		dungeon. What information is shown here is dependent on what level is
		selected in the drop down list on the ribbon bar.
	</p>
	<img src="help/DungeonEditor1.png">
	<p>Following is a brief description of what the items in this view
		do.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Manage Dungeons button</li>
		<p>
			This will call up the Manage Dungeons Dialog box allowing you to
			switch dungeons or create new ones as described in <a
				href="#CreateNewDungeon">Creating a New Dungeon.</a>
		</p>
		<li>New Level button</li>
		<p>This will clear out the information for the current level and
			make the entries ready for a new one. You just need to fill in the
			appropriate information and click the save button to create the new
			level.</p>
		<li>DELETE Level button</li>
		<p>
			This delete the currently selected level. <b>There is no undo so
				be very careful with this.</b>
		</p>
		<li>Level Name</li>
		<p>This is where you enter or change the name of the selected
			level</p>
		<li>Show Grid checkbox</li>
		<p>This is where you enable or disable the grid from showing on
			the map. This is mainly used for sizing the grid. Most maps have the
			grid already drawn on them but this tool needs to match that grid in
			size and position so you would enable the grid to help with that</p>
		<li>Grid Size button</li>
		<p>To assist in figuring out the size of a grid square you can do
			the following. Go to the map and zoom in until one square is pretty
			large. Then control click in the upper left corner of the square and
			draw a rectangle to the lower right corner. Then release the mouse
			button. The size of this box will get captured internally and get put
			into the Dungeon editor dialog when you press the Grid Size button.
			This will get the number close but might need some manual tweaking.
			The number can have a decimal point in it so you can fine tune it.</p>
		<img src="help/DungeonEditor2.png">
		<li>OffsetX and OffsetY</li>
		<p>Once you have the grid size correct you probable will need to
			have the grid move up, down, left or right. You enter decimal numbers
			in Offset X and Y to do that.</p>
		<li>Use Selected picture resource button</li>
		<p>
			The text area next to this button is where you enter the URL for the
			picture you wish to use for this level. The picture can be gotten
			from the internet by using its web path. It can also be gotten from
			one of your assets you upload in the asset management tab. Just go
			there and select the picture then come back here and press the <b>Selected
				picture resource</b> button.
		</p>
		<li>Save button</li>
		<p>If all information in the dialog area is correct then the save
			button will enable. Just press it to save the data. If you had pushed
			the New Level button then a new level will be created with the
			information else the existing level will be edited.</p>
		<li>Cancel button</li>
		<p>Pressing cancel will throw away changes and revert back to
			original information.</p>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="ManagePogs">Managing Pogs</h2>
	<p>
		The tab labeled <b>Pog Editor</b> allows you to edit, create and
		delete pogs. Pogs are the little pictures you can create and drop onto
		the map. They represent the monsters, Player characters, and room
		object that might exist in the dungeon.
	</p>
	<img src="help/PogEditor1.png">
	<ul>
		<li>Create Pog Button</li>
		<p>This will clear out the dialog information in preparation for
			creating a new Pog.</p>
		<li>DELETE Pog Button</li>
		<p>
			This delete the currently selected pog. <b>There is no undo so be
				very careful with this.</b>
		</p>
		<li>Pog Name</li>
		<p>
			This is where you give your pog a name. I suggest you use the
			following guideline in doing that. Make the name by using RACE CLASS
			SEX separated by spaces. By doing this in the future filtering can
			easily be added to narrow down choices to help find things.</b>
		</p>
		<li>Pog type</li>
		<p>
			There are three choices. MONSTER, ROOM OBJECT, and PLAYER. The type
			are mostly to help separate them in lists. Players are the only
			unique ones because there can only ever be one instance. So if you
			drag and drop them on a different map they disappear from the
			original map. Also PLAYER can only be created and used when DMing a
			session because they exist in the Session data and not in the dungeon
			data as explained later.</b>
		</p>
		<li>Pog Location</li>
		<p>This is where the data for this pog resides. Following are the
			possibilities.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Dungeon Level</li>
			<p>This means the data exists in the dungeonData.json file in the
				section for a specific level. Most of the time data is gotten here
				by dragging and dropping a pog from the ribbon bar onto the map. A
				copy of the select pogs information in placed in the Dungeon Level.
				This is where you would also create and dungeon specific pogs.</p>
			<li>Session Level</li>
			<p>This means the data for the pog is stored in the
				sessionData.json file in a specific session. This file starts out as
				a copy of dungeonData.json file. This way any pogs moved around,
				created or deleted only affect the one session. Data is only changed
				here when the DM is managing a session.</p>
			<li>Player Location</li>
			<p>This means the data for the pog is stored in the
				sessionData.json file in a specific session. The data for these
				player characters are in a special portion of the sessionData.json
				file. Data is only changed here when the DM is managing a session.</p>
			<li>Common Resource</li>
			<p>This means the data for the pog is stored in the pogs.json
				file in common resource area. This area is outside of any specific
				dungeon and therefore applies to all of them. This is where you
				would add pogs that all dungeons might shares like Kobolds.</p>
		</ul>
		<li>Use Selected picture resource button</li>
		<p>
			The text area next to this button is where you enter the URL for the
			picture you wish to use for this pog. The picture can be gotten from
			the internet by using its web path. It can also be gotten from one of
			your assets you upload in the asset management tab. Just go there and
			select the picture then come back here and press the <b>Selected
				picture resource</b> button.
		</p>
		<li>Edit Notes button</li>
		<p>Pressing this button will bring up a dialog box the will allow
			you edit either the player visible notes or the DM notes that the
			players don't see. Any pog can have notes on them. These are useful
			for adding box text to the map.</p>
		<li>Pog size drop down</li>
		<p>Next to the notes button is a size drop down. Normal means the
			pog takes up one grid square. Large is 2x2. Huge is 3x3. Gargantuan
			is 4x4</p>
		<li>Player Flags button</li>
		<p>This button will bring up a dialog to select player flags.
			These are flags players can adjust during a session.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Dead</li>
			<p>This means the monster or player is dead. An indicator will be
				placed on the Pog to denote that.</p>
			<li>Invisible</li>
			<p>This means the monster or player is invisible. The pog will be
				transparent to denote that. This transparent pog can be seen by
				players.</p>
		</ul>
		<li>DM Flags button</li>
		<p>This button will bring up a dialog to select DM flags. These
			are flags only a DM can manipulate.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Invisible to Player</li>
			<p>This means the monster or PC is invisible to players. The pog
				will be transparent to the DM denote that. This transparent pog
				cannot be seen by players.</p>
			<li>Transparent Background</li>
			<p>If the picture for a pog has a transparent background then it
				is allowed to be used. Otherwise a white background is used.</p>
			<li>Shift to Right</li>
			<p>Normally pogs are draw with the upper left corner matching the
				upper left corner of a grid square. Something you might wish it to
				be over a bit for example a secret door would be on the wall and not
				in a square. By selecting this option the pog will move to the right
				half a square.</p>
			<li>Shift to Top</li>
			<p>Normally pogs are draw with the upper left corner matching the
				upper left corner of a grid square. Something you might wish it to
				be over a bit for example a secret door would be on the wall and not
				in a square. By selecting this option the pog will move up half a
				square.</p>
			<li>Dark background in edit mode</li>
			<p>Sometimes a light pog picture is hard to see against a light
				background. By making the background dark in edit mode it helps.</p>
		</ul>
		<li>Save button</li>
		<p>If all information in the dialog area is correct then the save
			button will enable. Just press it to save the data. If you had pushed
			the New Pog button then a new pog will be created with the
			information else the existing pog will be edited.</p>
		<li>Cancel button</li>
		<p>Pressing cancel will throw away changes and revert back to
			original information.</p>
		<li>Pog trees</li>
		<p>Below the editable area is where to trees of existing pogs
			lives. you can use this to find and select a particular pog. The
			information for it will show up in the edit area and its picture will
			show up in both the ribbon bar and at the lower part of this panel.
			You can drag and drop either picture to create a copy on the map.</p>
	</ul>







	<h3 id="CreateDungeonLevel">Create a new Dungeon Level</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>From the ribbon bar click the &quot;&quot;<b>Level
				Options&quot; button</b>&quot; as show below
		</li>
		<img src="help/RibbonBar4.png">
		<p>
			<big><b>Caution you are editing the existing level be sure
					to do the following steps before changing anything!</b></big>
		</p>
		<li>In the Level options dialog click the &quot;<b>Create New
				Level</b>&quot; button
		</li>
		<p>This will initialize the dialog and get it ready to create a
			new level</p>
		<li>Type the name of the new level into the level name text box</li>
		<li>Upload a picture for the level</li>
		<p>
			The level will already have a picture. It was copied from level 1 on
			the Template Dungeon but this probably isn't what you want. If you
			have a png or jpeg picture already you can upload that. If you just
			want to create a picture starting from the existing one you can
			download and edit that. To upload a picture hit the &quot;<b>Choose
				File</b>&quot; button and navigate to your picture. The picture will not
			actually get upload until you hit the Ok button.
		</p>
		<li>Adjust grid information</li>
		<p>
			Electronic battle mat uses a grid to hold pog images. Many times the
			picture that you upload also has a grid so we want the two to match
			up. So you will need to play with the grid options to make that
			happen. &quot;<b>Grid Size</b>&quot; is the amount of pixels that a
			square in the grid is on every size. A number between 30 and 60 is
			typical. Many times that grid in a picture doesn't start off exactly
			in the upper left corner so you can play with "Grid Offest X and Y"
			to make it line up. These values are double precision so you can
			enter something like 13.5 to get it very precise.
		</p>
		<li>Once everything is entered click the &quot;<b>Ok</b>&quot;
			button to create the actual level
		</li>
		<li>You will need to select the new level in the drop down list
			to see it.</li>
		<img src="help/RibbonBar3.png">
		<p>You might have to go back to the level option dialog several
			times to get the grid alignment to exactly match up.</p>
	</ol>

	<h3 id="EditDungeonLevel">Editing a Dungeon Level</h3>
	<p>From the ribbon bar select the level to edit as show below</p>
	<img src="help/RibbonBar3.png">
	<p>
		If you want to change the picture of adjust the grid follow steps 4
		and higher in the <a href="#CreateDungeonLevel">Create a new
			Dungeon Level</a> Mainly the job of editing a dungeon involves placing
		pogs into the grid over the level picture and adjusting the properties
		of the pog. You can move a pog around if it is already on the map by
		left clicking on it, and while holding the mouse button down, move it
		to a new spot. You can also do this on a touch screen by touching the
		pog and drag it. You can add new pogs to the map by dragging and
		dropping one from the <b>Selected Pog Area</b>. See the section below
		about <a href="#SelectedPogOperations">Selected Pog Operations</a>
	</p>
	<h3 id="SelectedPogOperations">Selected Pog Operations</h3>
	<p>
		There is an area on the ribbon bar that represents the <b>Selected
			Pog</b> as shown below. Basically the selected pog is the last pog that
		was operated on.
	</p>
	<img src="help/RibbonBar2.png">
	<p>In the edit mode there are two ways to set the selected pog.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Click on a pog that is already on the map.</li>
		<p>The selected pog on the map will have a black border around it
			to help identify it.</p>
		<li>Use one of the pog editors as shown below to create, edit or
			select either a Monster or a Room Object pog. More about these
			dialogs will be explain in their sections <a href="#EditPogArea">Pog
				Editors</a>.
		</li>
		<img src="help/RibbonBar6.png">
		<img src="help/RibbonBar5.png">
	</ol>
	<p>
		Many operations are affected by the selected pog. For example you can
		select a Monster pog on the map an then hit the Monster editor button
		to edit that one instance of monster. You can drag from the selected
		pog area onto the map to create another new instance of the monster
		including any edits you made to it. See section on <a
			href="#DungeonSpecificPogs">Creating Dungeon Specific Pogs</a>

	<p>A common resource pog is either a monster or a room object that
		is in a common pool that can be used across all dungeons. The template
		editors have two major areas as explained below.</p>
	<h4 id="SelectTemplateArea">Select template area</h4>
	<img src="help/MonsterTemplateDialog2.png">
	<p>
		This area is where you select an existing common template. Since there
		can be hundreds or thousands of items in the common area a filtering
		mechanism is supplied to help in the selection. Just select the
		appropriate filters from the drop down lists and then hit the &quot;<b>Apply
			Filters</b>&quot; button to populate the drop down list below the button.
		Then select the appropriate item from the list to make it the selected
		pog. The edit section of the dialog should then fill in with the
		correct information.
	</p>
	<p>
		<big><b>CAUTION When this dialog first comes up the
				information in the edit section will be for the selected pog. This
				is probably not a common template so make sure you do the selection
				steps first!</b></big>
	</p>
	<h4 id="EditPogArea">Edit Pog area</h4>
	<img src="help/MonsterTemplateDialog3.png">
	<p>This area is where you edit information about a pog. A pog needs
		a unique name and a URL to a valid picture. The picture has to end
		with extension png, jpg, or jpeg. If a valid url is entered then the
		picture should show up on the bottom of the dialog. You can also edit
		some filtering information like class, race, or gender. If this is a
		common resource pog it will then help with filtering in the selection
		area. Be careful with the case of the typing. "orc" and "Orc" will
		show up as two different races in the filter list.</p>
	<h4 id="CreateTemplatePog">Create Template pog</h4>
	<p>
		To create a new template pog in the common area hit the &quot;<b>Create
			New Template</b>&quot; button. This will clear out the edit section. You
		will then need to fill in the correct information for the new pog.
		Once you hit Ok the new common template pog will be created.
	</p>
	<h3 id="DungeonSpecificPogs">Creating Dungeon Specific Pogs</h3>
	<p>Sometimes a dungeon has some quirky pogs that don't really
		belong in the common pool for other dungeons. To create one is
		straight forward. Just select any pog of the appropriate type either
		Monster or Room Object. Then drag it from the selected Pog area on the
		ribbon bar to a place on the map. This will create a dungeon specific
		instance. Then make sure to reselect it on the map so it becomes the
		selected pog. Then call up the appropriate editor from the ribbon bar
		for example Monster Editor. Then go to the edit section of the dialog
		and fill in all the new information about this pog.</p>
	<h2 id="DungeonSessions">Dungeon Sessions</h2>
	<p>Dungeon sessions are a concept to help different groups of
		individuals play the same dungeon at the same time. Sessions make it
		possible so changes that one DM makes do not affect the other groups
		also playing. Essentially a session is a copy of a dungeon template
		that is then owned by a groups. All changes just happen in the copy.</p>
	<h3 id="CreatingaSession">Creating a Session</h3>
	<p>To create a new session do the following steps.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Get into the Manage Dungeons dialog.</li>
		<p>You can do this by revisiting the Electronic Battle Mat screen
			and log back in.</p>
		<li>Check the <b>I am DM</b> check box
		<li>Select the template dungeon you wish to make a session for</li>
		<img src="help/ManageDungeons.png">
		<li>Enter a new Session name</li>
		<p>This name must be unique from other sessions in this dungeon
			and it must be at least 4 characters long and can't start with "Enter
			"</p>
		<img src="help/ManageDungeons3.png">
		<li>Click the &quot;<b>Create New Session</b>&quot; to create the
			session.
		</li>
		<p>Now the Session name should be in the Select session list. This
			makes it available for functions like "DM the Session" or "Delete the
			Session"</p>
		<p>
			<b>NOTICE: Once you create a session any edits you make on the
				template dungeon will not show up in the session. This is because a
				session is actually a copy of the dungeons database so any new
				changes will not show up in the copy.</b>
		</p>
	</ol>
