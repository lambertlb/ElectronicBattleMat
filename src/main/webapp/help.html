	<h2 id="Overview">Electronic Battle Mat Overview</h2>
	<p>Electronic Battle mat is a Web Application to help DMs and
		players have a better experience for running a role playing game. It
		encompasses four modes of operation.
	<ol>
		<li>Creating and editing Template dungeons</li>
		<p>Template dungeons contain all the maps and resources needed for
			managing a single adventure. It is called a template because it is
			not actually used directly by end users. This is because multiple
			groups could be playing the same dungeon at the same time and you
			would not want them to interfere with each other.</p>
		<li>Creating Dungeon Session</li>
		<p>A dungeon session is a copy of a dungeon template that is owned
			by a certain group. This session is private so it can be changed
			without interfering with other groups playing the same one.</p>
		<li>DMing a Session</li>
		<p>
			In this mode of operation a DM takes control of a session. They can
			do may things like clear areas of FOG of WAR so players can see
			stuff. They can make monsters and room objects visible or invisible
			to players. They can move pogs around the map to show correct
			positions. They can add new stuff like monsters that were not in the
			dungeon template <b>SURPRISE this dragon happened by and wants to
				eat your face</b>.
		</p>
		<li>Player joining a Session</li>
		<p>In this mode of operation a player can view the Battle Mat.
			They have very little functionality other than panning and zooming
			the map. They can also create a PC pog and move it around the visible
			areas of the map.</p>
	</ol>
	</p>
	<h2 id="CreateNewDungeon">Creating a New Dungeon</h2>
	<p>
		These are the steps to create a new dungeon. They are performed in the
		Dungeon Manager Dialog when &quot;<b>I am DM</b>&quot; is checked
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Check the <b>I am DM</b> check box
		</li>
		<p>This opens up all the operations and privileges of a Dungeon
			Master.</p>
		<li>Name the new dungeon</li>
		<p>
			In the text box labeled "<b>Enter Dungeon Name</b>&quot; enter the
			name of your new dungeon. You can use letters, numbers and spaces in
			the name. The name must be greater than 4 letters long and cannot
			match an existing name. Once a legal name is entered the &quot;<b>Create
				New Dungeon</b>&quot; button will be enabled.
		</p>
		<img src="help/ManageDungeons2.png">
		<li>Click the &quot;<b>Create New Dungeon</b>&quot; button
			<p>
				This will create a new dungeon with the entered name by copying the
				"Template" dungeon. It should now be visible in the &quot;<b>Select
					a Dungeon for Operations</b>&quot; list.
			</p> <img src="help/ManageDungeons7.png">
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h2 id="EditDungeon">Editing a Dungeon</h2>
	<p>
		These are the steps to edit a dungeon. They are performed in the
		Dungeon Manager Dialog when &quot;<b>I am DM</b>&quot; is checked
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Check the <b>I am DM</b> check box
		</li>
		<p>This opens up all the operations and privileges of a Dungeon
			Master.</p>
		<li>Select a Dungeon to edit</li>
		<p>
			In the drop down called &quot;<b>Select a Dungeon for Operations</b>&quot;
			select a dungeon to edit. This will enable the &quot;<b>Edit
				Dungeon</b>&quot; button.
		</p>
		<li>Press the &quot;<b>Edit Dungeon</b>&quot; button
		</li>
		<p>This will load in the dungeon and display the first level map.
			The ribbon bar will also map to the available operations that the DM
			can do on the dungeon.</p>
	</ol>
	<h3 id="DungeonEditorLayout>">Dungeon Editor Layout</h3>
	<p>This is how the editor should look when it is first opened up on
		a new dungeon created from the "Template" dungeon.</p>

		<li>Show Selected Pog Checkbox</li>
		<img src="help/RibbonBar4.png">
		<p>By checking this box you will cause a floating dialog window to

		<li>Show Help</li>
		<img src="help/RibbonBar5.png">
		<p>By clicking here you will get this help page.</p>
	</ol>
	<h3 id="BattleMat">Battle Mat Area</h3>
	<p>
		This area is where the map and all the objects placed on it appear.
		When you are DMing a session this will also display the areas that
		have <b>Fog of War (FOW)</b> on them. It will be transparent to the DM
		but will be solid black to the players preventing them from seeing
		stuff. Following are a few things you can do with and to this area.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Pan the Map</li>
		<p>By clicking on the map and holding the mouse button down you
			can change the position of the map.</p>
		<li>Zoom the Map</li>
		<p>By spinning the center mouse button you can zoom in and out of
			the map.</p>
		<li>Move Pogs around</li>
		<p>You can click on a pog and drag it to a new spot.</p>
		<li>Add new pogs to map</li>
		<p>By dragging an dropping a picture of a pog from the ribbon bar
			you will create a new pog on the map. This is a copy of the pog and
			not the original. So if you want two more of a monster already on the
			map. You just need to select it so it shows in the ribbon bar then
			drag and drop twice from the ribbon bar.</p>
		<li>Change properties of a pog</li>
		<p>By right clicking on a pog you can change some properties. Like
			make it visible or invisible to players or give it a number to help
			players more easily identify it. You can even delete it from the map.</p>
	</ol>
	<h3 id="InformationManagement">Information Management area</h3>
	<p>This area allows the DM to edit and create all kinds of
		information related to the dungeon. It is broken into different tabs
		to help separate functionality.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Art Assets</li>
		<p>This area allows you to manage the artwork needed for you dungeon</p>
		<li>Dungeon Editor</li>
		<p>This area allows you to edit and add dungeon levels</p>
		<li>Pog Editor</li>
		<p>This area allows you to do things like edit, create and delete pogs.</p>
	</ol>

















	<h3 id="CreateDungeonLevel">Create a new Dungeon Level</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>From the ribbon bar click the &quot;&quot;<b>Level
				Options&quot; button</b>&quot; as show below
		</li>
		<img src="help/RibbonBar4.png">
		<p>
			<big><b>Caution you are editing the existing level be sure
					to do the following steps before changing anything!</b></big>
		</p>
		<li>In the Level options dialog click the &quot;<b>Create New
				Level</b>&quot; button
		</li>
		<p>This will initialize the dialog and get it ready to create a
			new level</p>
		<li>Type the name of the new level into the level name text box</li>
		<li>Upload a picture for the level</li>
		<p>
			The level will already have a picture. It was copied from level 1 on
			the Template Dungeon but this probably isn't what you want. If you
			have a png or jpeg picture already you can upload that. If you just
			want to create a picture starting from the existing one you can
			download and edit that. To upload a picture hit the &quot;<b>Choose
				File</b>&quot; button and navigate to your picture. The picture will not
			actually get upload until you hit the Ok button.
		</p>
		<li>Adjust grid information</li>
		<p>
			Electronic battle mat uses a grid to hold pog images. Many times the
			picture that you upload also has a grid so we want the two to match
			up. So you will need to play with the grid options to make that
			happen. &quot;<b>Grid Size</b>&quot; is the amount of pixels that a
			square in the grid is on every size. A number between 30 and 60 is
			typical. Many times that grid in a picture doesn't start off exactly
			in the upper left corner so you can play with "Grid Offest X and Y"
			to make it line up. These values are double precision so you can
			enter something like 13.5 to get it very precise.
		</p>
		<li>Once everything is entered click the &quot;<b>Ok</b>&quot;
			button to create the actual level
		</li>
		<li>You will need to select the new level in the drop down list
			to see it.</li>
		<img src="help/RibbonBar3.png">
		<p>You might have to go back to the level option dialog several
			times to get the grid alignment to exactly match up.</p>
	</ol>

	<h3 id="EditDungeonLevel">Editing a Dungeon Level</h3>
	<p>From the ribbon bar select the level to edit as show below</p>
	<img src="help/RibbonBar3.png">
	<p>
		If you want to change the picture of adjust the grid follow steps 4
		and higher in the <a href="#CreateDungeonLevel">Create a new
			Dungeon Level</a> Mainly the job of editing a dungeon involves placing
		pogs into the grid over the level picture and adjusting the properties
		of the pog. You can move a pog around if it is already on the map by
		left clicking on it, and while holding the mouse button down, move it
		to a new spot. You can also do this on a touch screen by touching the
		pog and drag it. You can add new pogs to the map by dragging and
		dropping one from the <b>Selected Pog Area</b>. See the section below
		about <a href="#SelectedPogOperations">Selected Pog Operations</a>
	</p>
	<h3 id="SelectedPogOperations">Selected Pog Operations</h3>
	<p>
		There is an area on the ribbon bar that represents the <b>Selected
			Pog</b> as shown below. Basically the selected pog is the last pog that
		was operated on.
	</p>
	<img src="help/RibbonBar2.png">
	<p>In the edit mode there are two ways to set the selected pog.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Click on a pog that is already on the map.</li>
		<p>The selected pog on the map will have a black border around it
			to help identify it.</p>
		<li>Use one of the pog editors as shown below to create, edit or
			select either a Monster or a Room Object pog. More about these
			dialogs will be explain in their sections <a href="#EditPogArea">Pog
				Editors</a>.
		</li>
		<img src="help/RibbonBar6.png">
		<img src="help/RibbonBar5.png">
	</ol>
	<p>
		Many operations are affected by the selected pog. For example you can
		select a Monster pog on the map an then hit the Monster editor button
		to edit that one instance of monster. You can drag from the selected
		pog area onto the map to create another new instance of the monster
		including any edits you made to it. See section on <a
			href="#DungeonSpecificPogs">Creating Dungeon Specific Pogs</a>
	</p>
	<h3 id="ManagingCommonResourcePogs">Managing Common Resource Pogs</h3>
	<p>A common resource pog is either a monster or a room object that
		is in a common pool that can be used across all dungeons. The template
		editors have two major areas as explained below.</p>
	<h4 id="SelectTemplateArea">Select template area</h4>
	<img src="help/MonsterTemplateDialog2.png">
	<p>
		This area is where you select an existing common template. Since there
		can be hundreds or thousands of items in the common area a filtering
		mechanism is supplied to help in the selection. Just select the
		appropriate filters from the drop down lists and then hit the &quot;<b>Apply
			Filters</b>&quot; button to populate the drop down list below the button.
		Then select the appropriate item from the list to make it the selected
		pog. The edit section of the dialog should then fill in with the
		correct information.
	</p>
	<p>
		<big><b>CAUTION When this dialog first comes up the
				information in the edit section will be for the selected pog. This
				is probably not a common template so make sure you do the selection
				steps first!</b></big>
	</p>
	<h4 id="EditPogArea">Edit Pog area</h4>
	<img src="help/MonsterTemplateDialog3.png">
	<p>This area is where you edit information about a pog. A pog needs
		a unique name and a URL to a valid picture. The picture has to end
		with extension png, jpg, or jpeg. If a valid url is entered then the
		picture should show up on the bottom of the dialog. You can also edit
		some filtering information like class, race, or gender. If this is a
		common resource pog it will then help with filtering in the selection
		area. Be careful with the case of the typing. "orc" and "Orc" will
		show up as two different races in the filter list.</p>
	<h4 id="CreateTemplatePog">Create Template pog</h4>
	<p>
		To create a new template pog in the common area hit the &quot;<b>Create
			New Template</b>&quot; button. This will clear out the edit section. You
		will then need to fill in the correct information for the new pog.
		Once you hit Ok the new common template pog will be created.
	</p>
	<h3 id="DungeonSpecificPogs">Creating Dungeon Specific Pogs</h3>
	<p>Sometimes a dungeon has some quirky pogs that don't really
		belong in the common pool for other dungeons. To create one is
		straight forward. Just select any pog of the appropriate type either
		Monster or Room Object. Then drag it from the selected Pog area on the
		ribbon bar to a place on the map. This will create a dungeon specific
		instance. Then make sure to reselect it on the map so it becomes the
		selected pog. Then call up the appropriate editor from the ribbon bar
		for example Monster Editor. Then go to the edit section of the dialog
		and fill in all the new information about this pog.</p>
	<h2 id="DungeonSessions">Dungeon Sessions</h2>
	<p>Dungeon sessions are a concept to help different groups of
		individuals play the same dungeon at the same time. Sessions make it
		possible so changes that one DM makes do not affect the other groups
		also playing. Essentially a session is a copy of a dungeon template
		that is then owned by a groups. All changes just happen in the copy.</p>
	<h3 id="CreatingaSession">Creating a Session</h3>
	<p>To create a new session do the following steps.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Get into the Manage Dungeons dialog.</li>
		<p>You can do this by revisiting the Electronic Battle Mat screen
			and log back in.</p>
		<li>Check the <b>I am DM</b> check box
		<li>Select the template dungeon you wish to make a session for</li>
		<img src="help/ManageDungeons.png">
		<li>Enter a new Session name</li>
		<p>This name must be unique from other sessions in this dungeon
			and it must be at least 4 characters long and can't start with "Enter
			"</p>
		<img src="help/ManageDungeons3.png">
		<li>Click the &quot;<b>Create New Session</b>&quot; to create the
			session.
		</li>
		<p>Now the Session name should be in the Select session list. This
			makes it available for functions like "DM the Session" or "Delete the
			Session"</p>
		<p>
			<b>NOTICE: Once you create a session any edits you make on the
				template dungeon will not show up in the session. This is because a
				session is actually a copy of the dungeons database so any new
				changes will not show up in the copy.</b>
		</p>
	</ol>
