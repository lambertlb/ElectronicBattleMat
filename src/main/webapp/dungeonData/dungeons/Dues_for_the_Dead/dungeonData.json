It clutches a scroll in one hand, a quill in a second, a skull in a third, while the fourth is empty.","dmNotes":"The floor of the room is about 20 feet below that of the hallway leading into it, and the steps are about 3 feet wide. The stairs are also on the verge of collapse. Each character who uses the steps must make a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check at the midpoint of the stairs as they descend or ascend. An unsuccessful check causes 5 points of damage to the stairs. If the check succeeds, no damage is dealt to the stairs. Describe the creaking, cracking, and groaning from the ancient wood, and the dust that falls with every step. The staircase collapses when it accumulates 10 points of damage, dropping everyone on it to the floor of the room.
